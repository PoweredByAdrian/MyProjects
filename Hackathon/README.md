# DevvitDrawApp - Collaborative Drawing on Reddit

A real-time collaborative drawing application built for Reddit using the Devvit platform, where users can contribute one stroke each to create collective artwork.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for DevvitDrawApp came from the desire to create a unique form of digital collaboration within Reddit communities. We wanted to explore how strangers could come together to create something beautiful, with each person contributing just one stroke to a shared canvas. This concept draws from the philosophy that great art often emerges from collective creativity and diverse perspectives.

The project was also inspired by the technical challenge of building real-time collaborative applications on the Devvit platform, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Reddit's developer tools.

## What it does

DevvitDrawApp transforms Reddit posts into interactive collaborative canvases where:

- **One Stroke Per User**: Each participant can contribute exactly one stroke to the artwork
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Users see others' strokes appear in real-time as they draw
- **Completion System**: Artwork is automatically completed when 5 strokes are reached
- **Cooldown Management**: Users have a cooldown period between contributions to prevent spam
- **Persistent Storage**: All artwork is saved and can be viewed by the community
- **Brush Customization**: Users can choose from different colors and brush sizes
- **Completion Posts**: When artwork reaches 5 strokes, an automatic completion post is created showcasing the final piece

## How we built it

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for the interactive drawing interface
- **Backend**: Reddit Devvit platform with custom hooks and API handlers
- **Canvas Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas API with custom drawing utilities
- **Real-time Updates**: Polling-based collaboration system for stroke synchronization
- **State Management**: React hooks with careful state coordination

### Architecture Overview

The application is built using a modular hook-based architecture:

#### Core Hooks
- `useDrawing`: Manages drawing interactions, stroke validation, and completion logic
- `useCanvasSetup`: Handles canvas initialization and collaborative data loading
- `useCollaboration`: Manages real-time polling and stroke synchronization
- `useCooldown`: Implements user cooldown mechanics between strokes

#### Key Components
- **DrawingCanvas**: The main interactive canvas component
- **ColorPicker**: Brush color selection interface  
- **BrushSizer**: Brush size adjustment controls
- **StatusDisplay**: Shows drawing state, cooldowns, and completion status

#### Technical Challenges Solved

1. **Stroke Preservation System**: Implemented client-side stroke buffering to prevent user strokes from disappearing during collaborative updates
2. **Race Condition Handling**: Careful timing coordination between local drawing and server synchronization
3. **State Consistency**: Ensuring UI state remains consistent across multiple users and real-time updates
4. **Canvas Rendering Pipeline**: Optimized redraw mechanisms for smooth collaborative experience

### Mathematical Concepts

The drawing system uses coordinate transformation mathematics:

```latex
\text{Canvas Coordinates} = \begin{pmatrix} x_{canvas} \\ y_{canvas} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x_{event} - rect.left \\ y_{event} - rect.top \end{pmatrix}
```

Stroke interpolation uses linear interpolation between points:

```latex
P(t) = P_0 + t(P_1 - P_0), \quad t \in [0,1]
```

## Challenges we ran into

### 1. **Stroke Disappearing Bug**
**Problem**: User strokes would vanish during collaborative updates when the canvas was redrawn with server data.

**Solution**: Implemented a sophisticated stroke preservation system with client-side buffering that maintains user strokes during collaborative redraws.

### 2. **Race Conditions in State Management**
**Problem**: React state updates and server synchronization created timing issues where stroke counts would be incorrect.

**Solution**: Implemented ref-based immediate state checks and server-authoritative stroke counting.

### 3. **Canvas Rendering Pipeline Conflicts**
**Problem**: Multiple systems trying to redraw the canvas simultaneously caused rendering conflicts and canvas disappearing.

**Solution**: Careful timing coordination with setTimeout delays and conditional redraw logic.

### 4. **Real-time Collaboration Complexity**
**Problem**: Ensuring smooth real-time updates without interfering with active drawing sessions.

**Solution**: Implemented intelligent polling that respects drawing state and uses timestamp-based conflict resolution.

### 5. **Cooldown System Implementation**
**Problem**: Preventing spam while maintaining responsive user experience.

**Solution**: Server-side cooldown validation with client-side prediction for immediate feedback.
